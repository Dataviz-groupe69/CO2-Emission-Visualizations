[Visualizations of CO2 emissions](https://dataviz-groupe69.github.io/CO2-Emission-Visualizations)

For the course [Data-Visualization of the Lyon 1 Master 2](https://lyondataviz.github.io/teaching/lyon1-m2/2018/), we were asked to work on visualizations of a dataset on climate change.

We have therefore chosen to work on CO2 emissions, and thus to respond to several issues:

* See that CO2 emissions have been constantly increasing since the industrial period
* See the most polluting countries by year / since a given year
* Verification of the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature increase.
* To see if there is a link between CO2 emissions and sea level rise
